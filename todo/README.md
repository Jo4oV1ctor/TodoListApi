In the project directory, you can run:

cd .\todo
Accesses the root folder of the project, where all the necessary directories and components are located.

npm run db
Starts a db.json, which functions as the project's memory, storing and modifying data.
Open http://localhost:3030/todos to view it in the browser.

npm run dev
Runs the application in development mode.
Open http://localhost:5173/ to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You can also view lint errors in the console.

npm run build
Creates the production-ready application in the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.
Your application is ready to be deployed!

Refer to the deployment section for more information.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you're not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, so you have full control over them. All commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The feature set selected for this project is suitable for small and medium deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready.
